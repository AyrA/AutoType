# AutoType
Automatically types text into other applications

## How to use

Just double click the executable to open it.
You can also drag a text file onto the executable icon to open an existing text file.

Line breaks are converted to `{ENTER}`, you don't need to insert `{ENTER}` manually in those locations.
If you do the key will be pressed twice.

## Help

While editing, use the context menu (ESC key) to get a list of special characters you can insert.
The menu is also bound to the right mouse button as usual but the keystroke allows you to control it entirely using the Keyboard.
